  <h3> Health & Safety Policy for Child Care Settings </h3>
  <h4> The purpose of a health and safety policy in a child care setting is to provide parents with a written statement of the procedures in place to protect their children.</h4>
    	<dl id="setting">
		<dt> Prevention </dt>
			<dd>The policy should call for hand-washing by staff and children at arrival, when moving from one child care group to another, after handling pets or bodily fluid and before and after eating or handling food. Children and staff also need to wash hands after toileting and diapering, administering medication, sand or water play, or handling garbage or uncooked food. The policy should include provisions for sanitizing counters and table surfaces, toys, bathrooms and diaper changing areas, as well as for weekly cleaning of all bed linens used by the children.</dd>	
  		<dt> Illness</dt>
			<dd>The policy should identify criteria for the exclusion of ill children from the program. Symptoms requiring exclusion include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, discharge from the eye or others resulting from a known contagious illness.</dd>	
<dt> Provision for Emergency</dt>
			<dd>The health and safety policy should include plans for emergencies. Detail the policy for transporting a child to a health care facility, including a statement that the parent will be notified as soon as it is practical.</dd>	
<dt> Transportation</dt>
			<dd>A child care health and safety policy details provisions for the transporting of children, including the requirement that a signed permission form be on file for each child. </dd>	
<dt> Background and Medical Clearance</dt>
			<dd>Each adult who comes into contact with children in any capacity in a child care facility must receive background and medical clearance, and adherence to this regulation should be addressed in the health and safety policy.</dd>
